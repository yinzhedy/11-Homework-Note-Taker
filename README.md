## Description

  This is a note taker application that allows the user to create, save, edit, and delete notes. There is a landing / welcome page, with an enter site button. The note taker page itself, presented upon clicking the get started button on the landing page, includes options to delete, edit, save, and view saved notes. All notes must have a title. All notes are also presented with their creation date. There is also a submit feedback to the developer page, accessed via the submit feedback to the developer button on the note taker application page, to promote future improvements for the application. 


## Installation

  Ensure Node.js is installed. Ensure all necessary npm packages are installed. Open integrated terminal from the server.js file, or navigate to the server.js file in whatever terminal you're using, and enter the command 'node server.js' to launch the application on 3001. If not successful, double check nothing else is running on this port. Navigate to your browser and type in the address 'http://localhost:3001/' and then hit enter. This should launch the application on your web browser.
